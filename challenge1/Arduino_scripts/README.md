# Utilities:
 - `elf2hex.sh` converts a file generated by the Arduino compiler with the extension of `ino.elf` to a file with an extension `ino.hex`, which can be pushed to the Arduino
 - `push_hex.sh` pushes an `ino.hex` file to Arduino. It requires `sudo` on my machine
 - `compile.sh` compiles an `.ino` file, and puts the output in a folder it creates called `Build`.
   - Before running for the first time, install the borad:
     - Command to insatll the borad: `arduino --install-boards "arduino:avr:1.6.2"`
     - Download these libraries. Note that by default they have the same filename.
       - `https://github.com/pfeerick/elapsedMillis/archive/master.zip`
       - `https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield/archive/master.zip`
     - Using the GUI (`Arduino`) install these libraries. (sketch -> Include Library -> add zip library)
   - Note that this compilation is picky, and sometimes (not always) it insists that the file should be in a directory with the same name (`Blink/Blink.ino`)

# Test files:
 - `Blink.ino.elf` is a file I generated. It blinks LED 3, which is one of the LEDs on the car 3D printed car buffer.
 - `Blink/Blink.ino` is the source file of the above file

# Dependencies
- I do not list the explicitely here (just install what the script uses)
- On Ubuntu, the default `arduino` version is `1.0.5` (`apt install arduino`),
however, this version is too old and does not support the CLI instructions.
I use version `1.8.13`, which is the default on Archlinux.
